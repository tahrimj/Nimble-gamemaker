Nimble is a 2D platform game maker designed for younger age group.  
While the existing popular game engines provide hundreds and thousands of functionalities to make their games more realistic, 
they can also make the process very complex, which might demotivate young audience from creating games.
The objective of this project was to make a simple and easy to use game making platform which requires no prior coding knowledge. 
It is especially created and aimed for audience of younger age group and for those who are not familiar with coding.

This project is entirely written in C# programming language, and uses .NET framework, SFML as a graphics and multimedia library, and SQLite as database tool.

This project was created as a part of requirement for bachelor's degree, as a final year project.
