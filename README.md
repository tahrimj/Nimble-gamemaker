Nimble is a 2D platform game maker designed for younger age group. 
Unlike majority of game making software and engines in the market, Nimble is a code-free application that
makes game development easier and quicker. 
While the existing popular game engines provide hundreds and thousands of functionalities to make their games more realistic, they
can also make the process very complex, which might demotivate young audience from creating games.

The objective of this project was to make a simple and easy to use game making platform which requires no prior coding knowledge. 
It is especially created and aimed for audience of younger age group and for those who are not familiar with coding.

This project was created as a part of requirement of bachelor's degree, as a final year project.
